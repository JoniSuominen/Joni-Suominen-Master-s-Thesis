Digital cameras have become indispensable tools in today's society, playing pivotal roles across scientific research, industrial applications, and consumer needs. However, their spectral sensitivities differ markedly from the human visual system, leading to discrepancies in color representation and interpretation. Such deviations not only impact aesthetic quality but also significantly affect the accuracy of data-dependent applications, such as computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing. 

To view the colours of the image as if a human had viewed the scene, color correction has to be performed in order to map the colors from the camera's color space to a reference color space related to the HVS.
