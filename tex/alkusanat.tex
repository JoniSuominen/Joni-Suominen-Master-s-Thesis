The work on this thesis initially began as an industry project for Axon on camera spectral calibration, but soon turned into a personal research project on colour correction, as I found colour science fascinating.

I want to thank my supervisor, Karen Eguiazarian, for pushing me into a more research-oriented topic and for all his help during the process. Being able to publish a paper alongside my thesis was an experience that I wouldn't have expected a few years back, and really culminated my studies.

A big thanks goes to Mikko Vaahteranoksa, who introduced me to image quality and has guided me in my career, and also the rest of the camera team at Axon. I have been able to work flexibly with interesting projects from the start of my studies two years ago, to this date with enormous support.

Finally, I wish to thank my family for being understanding during these busy years.
